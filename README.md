# CS231FinalProject
The last project from my CS231 class (Data structures and Algorithms), finished about 2 years ago. 

To compile:
javac HuntTheWumpus.java

To run:
java HuntTheWumpus

To play: 
- Use <wasd> for movement
- Use <space> to hold arrow, and then <wasd> to choose a direction to shoot
- You only have 1 shot to kill the Wumpus and win
- To lose: Either shoot to the wrong block, or fall down the well (the Moon emoji), or run into the Wumpus and get eaten.
